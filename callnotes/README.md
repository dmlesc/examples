# callnotes

I made this tool I was working tech support at a webhosting company. Others had 
made tools but I made this one to fit my needs and style. If you don't like my 
style, feel free to change the colors (or anything else) to wh Maatever you like. 
This was the first real project that I did outside of school and I learned a lot
doing it. It was before I even knew what a framework was or I even knew of my 
aversion to frameworks, so all the Javascript is original. I tried to make it as 
concise as possible and created some helper functions to do so. I don't feel like 
taking the time to make it more concise because then I would be making my own MVC 
framework basically. Maybe that'll be for another project. :)

It's only been fully tested in Chrome becasue I think it looks better and it has 
faster Javascript processing (the animations are smoother) than other browsers.  

If you don't see the "hold" link at the bottom of the page, you have to disable 
the Bookmarks toolbar, the Menu bar, or the status bar. It's advisable to do 
this because the hold feature lets you know when you've been on hold longer 
than 2 minutes. 

I made this tool to reduce the amount of time it takes to log notes in the 
ticketing system(s). Especially when it comes to escalations/delegations and 
sending out emails as I didn't need to look up the correct template in the 
Knowledge Base.

You can use TAB and Shift-TAB to navigate through the form fields. Hitting TAB 
on the last field of each form takes you to the "create" link, which upon 
depressing the Enter key, creates the text you can then put into the case (the 
text is already selected, so all you have to do is Ctrl-C to copy).

The Additional Notes field is not included when you create the form. 

Please see the other comments next to the code for additional functionality.
