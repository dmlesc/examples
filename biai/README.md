This app/puzzle was inspired by the anual theme of a company I worked for a few years back.
It gave me a chance to explore a typing app that I thought of and to use some Math to draw
the slope of the flying letters.

You can get more concurrent letters moving on Chrome because by far it's the broswer with
the fastest Javascript processing at the time I made it. In my first iteration I didn't set 
<!DOCTYPE html> and it seems to process faster because I didn't have to add '+ "px"' for the 
style positions.

I'm sure there's some ways to optimize the code and I may refactor as my knowledge increases.
