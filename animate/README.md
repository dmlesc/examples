# animate

This is a fun little app to demonstrate some of my Javascript animation functions. I prefer to use
Javascript to animate instead of how normal people animate (CSS). Click on the cute kitten to see
it spin. I'm particularly proud of the circle animation because of the Math I had to do to generate
it - I generally don't like Math. I'm not quite sure why the animation appears to speed up at 
certain point in its lifecyle. That's something to figure out at a later time...
